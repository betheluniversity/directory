# directory

Coming soon!

A pythonic remake of the old directory.bethel.edu. The initial launch is mostly just a styling update, but there will be room for future updates now that we have access to edit the data and the styling.

The directory is mainly used for finding basic student, staff, and faculty information through sophisticated searching capabilities.
